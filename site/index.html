              humour with pathos so effectively that those
              qualities magnify each other rather than
              cancelling each other out. West has somehow
              stayed open and vulnerable in the face of
              constant attack, abuse that would turn a lot
              of people into a brittle shell, instead of a
              warm, capacious and funny writer."[4] Dayna
              Tortorici writing for The New York Times gave
              Shrill a mixed review, noting West’s "wildly
              generous attitude toward her audience — meeting
              readers at their point of prejudice so that she
              may, with&nbsp;visible&nbsp;,shepherd them
              toward a more humane point of view.&quot;
